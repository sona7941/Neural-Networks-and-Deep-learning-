        "\n",
        "1.  **Effectiveness**: The off-the-shelf `en_core_web_sm` model proved highly effective. The `displacy` view shows it correctly identified the key players (`InnovateCorp`, `Anya Sharma`), locations (`Bengaluru`, `Silicon Valley`), and financial figures (`$15 billion`).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **High-Level Insights**: The bar chart instantly confirms the article's focus. The most frequent entity types are **`ORG`** (organizations) and **`DATE`**, followed by `GPE` (locations), `MONEY`, and `PERSON`. This quantitative view validates our qualitative reading of the article.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Limitations**: The model is not perfect. For instance, the product name `\"Prometheus\"` was not identified, as the base model isn't trained for a `PRODUCT` category. For highly specialized tasks, one might need to train a custom NER model with domain-specific labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:** The structured and visualized data is now primed for powerful downstream applications like building knowledge graphs, automating market analysis reports, or enhancing semantic search engines."
